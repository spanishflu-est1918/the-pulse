## Shadow Over Innsmouth: Nonlinear Story System

This guide defines WHAT exists and WHEN things trigger—not WHERE or IN WHAT ORDER. The narrator adapts element placement based on player choices.

---

## THE WORLD

### Setting: Innsmouth

A forsaken seaport on the fog-choked New England coast, early 20th century. Gambrel-roofed homes sag under decades of neglect. Salt marshes exhale briny reek. The Atlantic gnaws at the edges. Devil Reef looms offshore.

**Sensory palette:** Fish-stink, croaking sounds, fog's damp embrace, creaking wood, distant chanting, the sea's incessant murmur.

**Tone:** Cosmic horror. Insignificance against an uncaring void. Dread of the unknowable. Sanity's slow unraveling. Write in the style of H.P. Lovecraft with a tint of R.L. Stine for accessibility.

### Locations (All Optional to Visit)

Players may explore any of these. Elements attach to whichever locations players choose.

| Location | Atmosphere | Potential Uses |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Harbor/Docks** | Rotting boats, fish bones, salt-rusted chains | Relic, informant, escape route, pursuit |
| **Esoteric Order Church** | Dagon symbols, croaking hymns, hooded figures | Relic, informant, ritual witness, pursuit |
| **Gilman House Hotel** | Decaying grandeur, watchful staff, locked rooms | Informant, documents, siege, dreams |
| **Town Library** | Dusty records, family trees, forbidden texts | Documents, lineage revelation, informant |
| **Marsh Refinery** | Abandoned machinery, chemical stench, hiding spots | Pursuit evasion, relic, informant |
| **Residential Streets** | Boarded windows, hostile stares, strange symbols | Atmosphere, pursuit, symbol clues |
| **Devil Reef** | Jagged rocks, submerged caves, chanting at night | Climax location, transformation, final choice |

**Narrator rule:** When players choose a location, decide which floating elements are present there. Don't force players toward specific locations.

## FLOATING ELEMENTS

These exist in the world. Their specific location is determined by player choices.

### The Relic (Tiara)

A tiara of whitish-gold with fish-like, almost humanoid carvings. Pulses with soft internal light. Unnervingly warm to touch.

**Can be found:**
- In a locked crate at the docks
- In a church reliquary
- In a hotel safe
- In a library display case
- Worn by a transformed local

**Associated puzzle:** Container requires solving (combination lock, cipher, ritual sequence). Clues exist elsewhere in town.

**Associated note:** "Worn by those who hear the call. The blood remembers what the mind forgets."

### The Informant

A local who knows too much and fears saying it. Jittery, paranoid, speaks in fragments.

**Can be:**
- A drunk sailor at the docks
- A nervous hotel clerk
- A reclusive librarian
- A half-transformed penitent at the church
- A fisherman's widow

**What they know:** The pact's history. The transformation. The reef's significance. They hint but never state directly.

**Trust mechanic:** Players must earn information through patience, bribery, solving their problem, or proving they're "not one of them."

**Associated note:** Whispered warning varies by context—"Stay off the reef," "Don't drink the water," "The new moon is coming."

### The Documents

Written evidence of the Obed Marsh pact and the Deep One bloodline.

**Can be found:**
- Ship logs at the docks
- Church records
- Hotel guest books
- Library genealogies
- A dead man's journal

**Content:** References to 1846 pact. Names of founding families. Description of "the change." Maps of reef tunnels.

**Associated puzzle:** Encoded (Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, or symbol translation). Key found elsewhere.

**Associated note:** "Obed traded gold for eternity."

### The Symbols

Eye atop wavy line. Sometimes with five-pointed star. Appear throughout town.

**Purpose:** Environmental storytelling. Can be used as:
- Navigation clues
- Warning signs
- Puzzle elements
- Foreshadowing

**Associated notes:** "Dagon watches." "The deep ones rise at the star's fall." "Look closer."

## TRIGGER CONDITIONS

These events fire based on player state, not story position.

### Pursuit Sequence

**Triggers when ANY of:**
- Players openly investigate cult activity
- Players acquire the relic
- Players speak too long with the informant
- Tension accumulates (3+ suspicious interactions)
- Night falls after significant discovery

**Manifestation:** Croaking figures, coordinated movement, cutting off escape routes. Not immediately violent—herding, testing, watching.

**Escalation:** Each evasion increases intensity. Culminates in siege or forced flight.

### Dream/Vision Sequence

**Triggers when ANY of:**
- Players sleep after encountering relic
- Players witness transformation
- Players read significant portion of documents
- Players approach Devil Reef
- High stress/sanity pressure moment

**Content:** Sunken city of Y'ha-nthlei. Non-Euclidean architecture. Hybrid beings. A sense of recognition, not fear. The feeling of "coming home."

**Revelation:** Players see themselves transformed. The dream feels like memory, not imagination.

### Transformation Signs

**Triggers when:**
- Players have extended contact with relic
- Players drink local water
- Cumulative exposure to Innsmouth influence
- Lineage revelation occurs

**Manifestation:** Subtle and escalating:
1. Skin feels dry away from water
2. Eyes seem wider in reflections
3. Faint pearlescent sheen
4. Others notice before players do

**Player choice:** Can be resisted (temporarily) or embraced.

### Lineage Revelation

**Triggers when:**
- Players find documents connecting them to founding families
- Informant recognizes "the look" in them
- Dream sequence shows their face among the Deep Ones
- Reflection in relic shows transformation
- Local addresses them as "cousin" or "kin"

**Core truth:** Players are not outsiders. They are returning heirs. The call that brought them was blood-memory.

## FIXED BEATS

These MUST happen. Order is flexible. Method is flexible.

### Beat 1: Arrival Hook
Players arrive in Innsmouth drawn by mysterious summons.

**Setup:** Letter, map, inherited deed, journalist assignment, academic research—whatever fits characters.

**Puzzle element:** Initial cipher or symbol-matching to establish location/confirm destination.

**Establishes:** Outsider status (which will be subverted). Curiosity or obligation driving investigation.

### Beat 2: The Town Rejects Them
Innsmouth does not welcome visitors.

**Manifestation:** Hostile stares. Refused service. Warnings to leave. Doors closing.

**Purpose:** Establishes danger. Creates "us vs. them" that will later collapse.

**Can occur:** Any public location. Cumulative across multiple interactions.

### Beat 3: First Supernatural Confirmation
Something undeniably wrong. Not suggestion—evidence.

**Options:**
- Witnessing partial transformation
- Relic's impossible warmth/glow
- Photograph shows things eye didn't see
- Spectroscope reads impossible biology
- Sound of mass croaking/chanting

**Purpose:** Shifts from "creepy town" to "cosmic horror." Players can no longer rationalize.

### Beat 4: The Truth About Them
Players learn they are connected to this place.

**Methods:** Lineage revelation trigger (see above).

**Purpose:** The horror becomes personal. They're not investigating monsters—they might BE monsters.

### Beat 5: The Choice
Accept transformation and join the deep, or reject it and flee/fight.

**Setting:** Ideally at Devil Reef or underwater, but can occur anywhere players make their stand.

**Options:**
- Embrace: Enter the water. Complete transformation. "Come home."
- Reject: Flee Innsmouth. Destroy relic. Fight the cult.
- Negotiate: Claim heritage on own terms. Neither fully human nor fully Deep One.

**No wrong answer:** All choices are valid endings. The horror is having to choose.

## NARRATOR ADAPTATION RULES

### When Players Go Somewhere Unexpected

Ask: "What floating element could be here?"

If they search the church when you'd planned the relic at the docks:
- The relic is now in the church
- The docks can have documents instead
- Or the docks become pure atmosphere/pursuit

### When Players Ignore the Obvious Hook

Let them. Another hook exists wherever they go instead.

"The players won't investigate the creepy church" → The church comes to them (cultist follows, symbol appears on their door, dreams reference it).

### When Players Try Something Not Covered

Say yes. Adapt floating elements.

"Can we steal a boat and leave immediately?" → Yes, but the pursuit triggers. Or the fog makes navigation impossible. Or they realize they don't WANT to leave (blood-pull).

### When Players Split Up

Each group encounters different elements. Compare notes later. Contradictions are features (unreliable perception, sanity erosion).

### Pacing Guidance

**~20 pulses typical:**
- Pulses 1-5: Arrival, rejection, atmosphere building
- Pulses 6-12: Investigation, discovery, mounting tension
- Pulses 13-18: Pursuit, revelation, transformation signs
- Pulses 19-20: Choice and resolution

**But this is descriptive, not prescriptive.** A group that rushes might hit choice at pulse 12. A group that lingers might need 25 pulses. Follow energy, not count.

### What Success Looks Like

Players feel they discovered the story, not that it was revealed to them. Their choices mattered—not just HOW they solved puzzles, but WHAT they investigated, WHERE they went, WHO they trusted.

Different groups playing this story should have genuinely different experiences while hitting the same emotional beats.
